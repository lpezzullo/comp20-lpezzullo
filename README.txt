Readme

This is a repository of all my work for Web Programming (Comp 20), Spring 2015. It includes client-side/front-end work, like HTML5 practice, as well as drafts of server-side work (done in Node.js using Express and MongoDB, and currently hosted live on Heroku).

My favorite assignment was Assignment 2. It was a big leap from the HTML/CSS styling work we had been doing (which I had done before, and which was fairly static). I liked the networking aspect, and while the asynchronous coding was a bit of a pain, I developed a much stronger grasp of the basics of event-based programming.

Through this class, I've grown to feel less scared of web development. It seems less like witchcraft to me, and more like a set of powerful tools. 

The most important thing I learned in this course was JavaScript. Knowing JavaScript itself is important, but it's also key because it provides access to a wealth of applications through APIs and acts as a gateway to any number of frameworks. We were able to write a web interface - the Marauder's Map - that does a lot of (what seemed to me like) big, complicated things like geolocation and a powerful map (through Google Maps API), using simple code, thanks to Javascript. An understanding of JavaScript was also essential for the security testing done in Assignment 4, which allowed me to spot vulnerabilities in the way my partner was handling data, not just in how he went about networking. 

Now that the course is finished, I'd like to start contributing to the open-source web apps I use. One that I use daily is written in AngularJS. There are a number of bugs in it that I've wanted to help fix, but I didn't feel confident enough in the past to try to modify any code. Now, learning AngularJS isn't nearly as intimidating, and I plan to start submitting fixes in the near future. I'd also like to learn more about front-end development for pages with a lot of dynamic content.
